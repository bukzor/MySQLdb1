MySQLdb1
========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bukzor/MySQLdb1.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/bukzor/MySQLdb1)

We have forked the ["legacy (1.x)"](http://github.com/farcepest/MySQLdb1)
version of MySQLdb in order to add python3 support, improve style, and
test out our ideas for supporting python2+3 code bases.

We're also testing out our [cpython "explicit encoding"
branch](https://github.com/bukzor/cpython) on this code base, but that
shouldn't afffect the final product, except to ensure we don't have any hidden
ascii-only edge cases.

To see our current plans, see our [TODO.md](https://github.com/bukzor/MySQLdb1/blob/development/TODO.md)
